# 10553527_BMS
Designed to showcase my knowledge of C#, this project applies the principles of programming and object-orientated programming to a console application that allows the user to manage the sale and letting of commercial and residential buildings. The application showcases the use of variables of different data types; do, while, and for loops; booleans, lists, and methods. It also deploys classes, objects, and inheritance to allow the user to add, remove, and show buildings, as well as additional functionality to sort, display, and edit information associated with specific buildings added to the application.
